Questions:

- I'm not sure how I got the enemy to show up, just go with it?
- flex currently, but would grid be better?
- I read about the font-size being 62.5% and then going with rem from there
- how do I keep it the same gosh darn size??? Does it have to deal with the pictures changing?? ***


next steps:
- images to be the same size
