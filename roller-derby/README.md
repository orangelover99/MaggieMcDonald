# roller-derby

This is meant to help the RockStar Roller Derby League keep track of information about their members.

It will tell information about:

- Name
- Nickname
- Number
- Pronouns
- Derby Spouse
- Derby Rival
- Derby Lineage

I am hoping to add these in the future:

- Real Name
- Picture in skating gear
- Picture out of skating gear
